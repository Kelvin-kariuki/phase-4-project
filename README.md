## Description
This is a site built on react and Ruby to display available tenders. Where a user can apply for a tender after logging in.

Later in the future the project will include a search bar  and a better footer with contact to all social sites

The project will be created with a backend database for deployement and updation

## Setup

As with other labs in this section, there is some starter code in place for a
Rails API backend and a React frontend. To get set up, run:

```console
$ bundle install
$ npm install --prefix client
```

You can work on this lab by running the tests with `learn test`. It will also be
helpful to see what's happening during the request/response cycle by running the
app in the browser. You can run the Rails server with:

```console
$ rails s
```

And you can run React in another terminal with:

```console
$ npm start --prefix client
```
